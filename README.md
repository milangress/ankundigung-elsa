# Hello Vue!

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a powerful tool for building javascript apps that bundles all of your code and shows immediate changes while you're editing. We're big fans!

While you're in the editor working, Glitch is running your `start` script in the background (`vite dev`). The site will be in dev mode and you'll see your changes happen immediately in the preview window. Once you close the editor window and your app goes to sleep, Glitch runs the `build` script and Vite builds your app for modern browsers.

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main page template Vue uses to build your site. When you're ready to share it or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder contains all the files Vue will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder üìÅ

‚Üê `src/main.js`: This is the root file of the Vue app. If you install plugins (like `vue-router`), they need be specified in that file!

‚Üê `src/App.vue`: The base for your Vue app, here is where the magic really happens. 

‚Üê `src/public/`: Static assets should be placed in the `public` folder. The files put in the `public` folder will simply be copied into the built files. 

‚Üê `src/assets/`: Media, such as images, can be placed in this folder.

‚Üê `src/components/HelloWorld.vue`: A demo Vue component that uses the *new* Vue Composition API to create a simple working counter.

All styles for this SPA can be found in `src/App.vue`.
